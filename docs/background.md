This section introduces the mathematical background behind the Simulated Bifurcation (SB) algorithm and its underlying principles of quadratic optimization. Even though knowing all the theory behind the algorithm is not required, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the foundational concepts outlined in this section.

Understanding the underlying mathematics provides valuable insights into the algorithm's behavior, its strengths, and potential limitations. Moreover, it equips users with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions when applying the algorithm to real-world optimization problems.

By delving into the mathematical background, users can enhance their problem-solving capabilities and optimize their use of the algorithm for maximum effectiveness.
