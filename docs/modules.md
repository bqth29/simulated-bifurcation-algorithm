This section introduces the different modules of the package with their respective classes and static methods. For each, a thorough documentation is provided to give insights on how to use this package effectively. The available modules are:

- [`simulated_bifurcation`](modules/simulated_bifurcation.md): Module defining high-level routines for a basic usage.
- [`core`](modules/core.md): Module of utility models to help define and solve optimization problems with the Simulated Bifurcation algorithm.
- [`optimizer`](modules/optimizer.md): Module providing an implementation of the Simulated Bifurcation algorithm. Serves as a back-end for the core module.
- [`models`](modules/models.md): Module containing the implementation of several common combinatorial optimization problems.
