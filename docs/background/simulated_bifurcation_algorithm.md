# Simulated Bifurcation algorithm

The **Simulated Bifurcation (SB) algorithm**[^1][^2][^3] is a fast and highly parallelizable state-of-the-art algorithm for combinatorial optimization inspired by quantum physics and spins dynamics. It was first introduced by Toshiba experts and relies on Hamiltonian quantum mechanics to find local minima of [Ising problems](quadratic_optimization.md#ising-model), known to be NP-hard.
