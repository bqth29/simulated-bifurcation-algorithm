Simulated Bifurcation
=====================

This package provides:

1. A GPU compatible implementation of the Simulated Bifurcation (SB) algorithm,
  a quantum physics inspired combinatorial optimization approximation algorithm.
2. An implementation of several common combinatorial optimization problems.
3. A polynomial API for further customization.

The Simulated Bifurcation (SB) algorithm is a randomized approximation
algorithm for combinatorial optimization problems. More specifically, it
solves the Ising problem, an NP-hard optimization problem which consists
in finding the ground state of an Ising model. It corresponds to the
minimization (or equivalently maximization) of a multivariate quadratic
polynomial over vectors whose entries are in {-1, 1}. Such polynomial
is the sum of a quadratic form and a linear form plus a constant term:
`ΣΣ Q(i,j)x(i)x(j) + Σ l(i)x(i) + c`. In matrix notation, this gives:
`x.T Q x + l.T x + c`, where `Q` is a square matrix, `l` a vector and
`c` a constant.

Several common combinatorial optimization problems are reframed as Ising
problems in the `models` module, e.g.: QUBO, knapsack, Markowitz model...
Polynomials over vectors whose entries are in {0, 1} or whose entries are
fixed bit-width integers are also implemented, as well as a utility
polynomial class `QuadraticPolynomial` for further customization.

The docstring examples assume that `torch` (PyTorch) and `sympy` (SymPy)
have been imported and that simulated_bifurcation has been imported as `sb`:

  >>> import torch
  >>> import simulated_bifurcation as sb

Code snippets are indicated by three greater-than signs:

  >>> x = 42
  >>> x += 1

Modules
-------
simulated_bifurcation:
    Module defining high-level routines for a basic usage.
core:
    Module of utility models to help define and solve optimization
    problems with the Simulated Bifurcation algorithm.
models:
    Package containing the implementation of several common combinatorial
    optimization problems.
optimizer:
    Provides an implementation of the Simulated Bifurcation algorithm.
    Serves as a back-end of the `core` module.
polynomial:
    Utility classes to define and utilize high-order multivariate
    polynomials.

Notes
-----
The SB algorithm is an approximation algorithm, which implies that the
returned values may not correspond to global optima. Therefore, if some
constraints are embedded as penalties in the polynomial, that is adding
terms that ensure that any global maximum satisfies the constraints, the
return values may violate these constraints.

The SB algorithm uses a randomized initialization, and this package is
implemented with a PyTorch backend. To ensure a consistent initialization
when running the same script multiple times, use `torch.manual_seed`.
However, results may not be reproducible between CPU and GPU executions,
even when using identical seeds. Furthermore, certain PyTorch operations
are not deterministic.
For more comprehensive details on reproducibility, refer to the PyTorch
documentation available at:
https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html.

The original version of the SB algorithm [1] is not implemented since
it is less efficient than the more recent variants of the SB algorithm
described in [2]:

- ballistic SB : Uses the position of the particles for the
  position-based update of the momentums ; usually faster but
  less accurate. Use this variant by setting `mode="ballistic"`.
- discrete SB : Uses the sign of the position of the particles for
  the position-based update of the momentums ; usually slower
  but more accurate. Use this variant by setting
  `mode="discrete"`.

On top of these two variants, an additional thermal fluctuation term
can be added in order to help escape local maxima [3]. Use this
additional term by setting `heated=True`.

The hyperparameters of the SB algorithm which correspond to physical
constants have been fine-tuned (Goto et al.) to give the best results most
of the time. Nevertheless, the relevance of specific hyperparameters may
vary depending on the properties of the instances. They can respectively be
modified and reset through the `set_env` and `reset_env` functions.

The time complexity is O(`max_steps` * `agents` * M^2) where M is the
dimension of the instance. The space complexity O(M^2 + `agents` * M).

For instances in low dimension (~100), running computations on GPU is
slower than running computations on CPU unless a large number of
agents (~2000) is used.

Minimize a polynomial over {0, 1} x {0, 1}

  >>> matrix = torch.tensor([[1, -2], [0, 3]], dtype=torch.float32)
  >>> vector = torch.tensor([3.5, 2.2], dtype=torch.float32)
  >>> constant = 3.14
  >>> best_vector, best_value = sb.minimize(
  ...     matrix, vector, constant, domain="binary"
  ... )
  >>> best_vector
  tensor([0., 0.])
  >>> best_value
  tensor(3.14)

Define an equivalent polynomial with a SymPy polynomial expression
for more readability

  >>> x, y = sympy.symbols("x y")
  >>> expression = sympy.poly(
  ...     x**2 - 2 * x * y + 3 * y**2
  ...     + 3.5 * x + 2.2 * y
  ...     + 3.14
  ... )
