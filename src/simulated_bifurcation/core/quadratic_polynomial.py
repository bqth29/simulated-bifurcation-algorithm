"""
Implementation of the QuadraticPolynomial class.

QuadraticPolynomial is a utility class to implement multivariate
quadratic polynomials from SymPy polynomial expressions or tensors.
They can automatically be casted to Ising model so they can be optimized
using the Simulated Bifurcation algorithm on a given domain. The available
domains are:

- spin optimization: variables are either -1 or +1
- binary optimization: variables are either 0 or 1
- n-bits integer optimization : variables are all integer values in the range
    0 to 2^n - 1 (inclusive)

class QuadraticPolynomial(object):
    """
    Internal implementation of a multivariate quadratic polynomial.

    A multivariate quadratic polynomial is the sum of a quadratic form and a
    linear form plus a constant term: `ΣΣ Q(i,j)x(i)x(j) + Σ l(i)x(i) + c`.
    In matrix notation, this gives: `x.T Q x + l.T x + c`, where `Q` is a
    square matrix, `l` a vector and `c` a constant.

    Multivariate quadratic polynomials are a common interface to express several
    optimization problems defined of different domains including:

    - spin optimization: variables are either -1 or +1
    - binary optimization: variables are either 0 or 1
    - n-bits integer optimization : variables are all integer values in the range
      0 to 2^n - 1 (inclusive)

    A multivariate quadratic polynomial defined on a given domain can be casted to
    an equivalent Ising model and thus optimized using the Simulated Bifurcation
    algorithm. The notion of equivalence means that finding the ground state of this
    Ising model is strictly equivalent to finding the vector solution that
    minimizes/maximizes the original polynomial when converted back to the original
    domain (for Ising optimization is in spins).

    Parameters
    ----------
    polynomial_data : sympy.Poly | Sequence[TensorLike]
        Source data of the multivariate quadratic polynomial to optimize. It can
        be a SymPy Poly or tensors/arrays of coefficients.
        If tensors/arrays are provided, the monomial degree associated to
        the coefficients is the number of dimensions of the tensor/array,
        and all dimensions must be equal. The quadratic tensor must be square and
        2-dimensional. The linear tensor must be 1-dimensional and the constant term
        can either be a float/int or a 0-dimensional tensor. All are optional.
        Tensors can be passed in an arbitrary order.

    Keyword-Only Parameters
    -----------------------
    dtype : torch.dtype, default=torch.float32
        Data-type used for the polynomial data.
    device : str | torch.device, default="cpu"
        Device on which the polynomial data is defined.

    Examples

      ...                   [0, 3]])
      >>> poly = QuadraticPolynomial(Q)

    (Option 2) Instantiate a polynomial from a SymPy poly

      >>> expression = sympy.poly(x**2 - 2 * x * y + 3 * y**2)
      >>> poly = QuadraticPolynomial(expression)

    Maximize the polynomial over {0, 1} x {0, 1}

      >>> best_vector
      tensor([0, 1])
      >>> best_value
      tensor(3)

    Return all the solutions found using 42 agents

      >>> best_vectors, best_values = poly.maximize(
      ...      agents=42, best_only=False
      ... )
      >>> best_vectors.shape  # (agents, dimension of the instance)
      (42, 2)
      >>> best_values.shape  # (agents,)
      (42,)

    Evaluate the polynomial at a single point

      >>> point = torch.tensor([1, 1], dtype=torch.float32)
      >>> poly(point)
      tensor(2)

    Evaluate the polynomial at several points simultaneously

      >>> points = torch.tensor(
      ...     [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]],
      ...     dtype=torch.float32,
      ... )
      >>> poly(points)
      tensor([0, 3, 1, 2])

    Migrate the polynomial to the GPU for faster computation

      >>> poly.to(device="cuda")

    Maximize this polynomial over {0, 1, ..., 14, 15} x {0, 1, ..., 14, 15}
    (outputs are located on the GPU)

      >>> best_vector, best_value = poly.maximize(domain="int4)
      >>> best_vector
      tensor([ 0., 15.], device='cuda:0')
      >>> best_value
      tensor(675., device='cuda:0')

    Evaluate this polynomial at a given point

      >>> point = torch.tensor([12, 7], dtype=torch.float32)
      >>> point = point.to(device="cuda")  # send tensor to GPU
      >>> poly(point)  # (output is located on GPU)

        Computes a local extremum of the model by optimizing
        the equivalent Ising model using the Simulated Bifurcation (SB)
        algorithm.

        The Simulated Bifurcation (SB) algorithm relies on
        Hamiltonian/quantum mechanics to find local minima of
        Ising problems. The spins dynamics is simulated using
        a first order symplectic integrator.

        There are different version of the SB algorithm:
        - the ballistic Simulated Bifurcation (bSB) which uses the particles'
        position for the matrix computations (usually faster but less accurate)
        - the discrete Simulated Bifurcation (dSB) which uses the particles'
        spin for the matrix computations (usually slower but more accurate)
        - the Heated ballistic Simulated Bifurcation (HbSB) which uses the bSB
        algorithm with a supplementary non-symplectic term to refine the model
        - the Heated ballistic Simulated Bifurcation (HdSB) which uses the dSB
        algorithm with a supplementary non-symplectic term to refine the model

        To stop the iterations of the symplectic integrator, a number of maximum
        steps needs to be specified. However, a refined way to stop is also possible
        using a window that checks that the spins have not changed among a set
        number of previous steps. In practice, a every fixed number of steps
        (called a sampling period) the current spins will be compared to the
        previous ones. If they remain constant throughout a certain number of
        consecutive samplings (called the convergence threshold), the spins are
        considered to have bifurcated and the algorithm stops.

        Finally, it is possible to make several particle vectors at the same
        time (each one being called an agent). As the vectors are randomly
        initialized, using several agents helps to explore the solution space
        and increases the probability of finding a better solution, though it
        also slightly increases the computation time. In the end, only the best
        spin vector (energy-wise) is kept and used as the new Ising model's
        ground state.
