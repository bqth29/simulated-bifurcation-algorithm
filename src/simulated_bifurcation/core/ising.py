class Ising:
    """
    Internal implementation of the Ising model.

    Solving an Ising problem means finding a spin vector `s` (with values
    in {-1, 1}) such that, given a matrix `J` with zero diagonal and a
    vector `h`, the following quantity - called Ising energy - is minimal
    (`s` is then called a ground state):
    `-0.5 * ΣΣ J(i,j)s(i)s(j) + Σ h(i)s(i)`

        Parameters
        ----------
        agents : int, default=128
            Number of simultaneous execution of the SB algorithm. This is
            much faster than sequentially running the SB algorithm `agents`
            times.
        max_steps : int, default=10_000
            Number of iterations after which the algorithm is stopped
            regardless of whether convergence has been achieved.
        ballistic : bool, default=False
            Whether to use the ballistic or the discrete SB algorithm.
            See Notes for further information about the variants of the SB
            algorithm.
        heated : bool, default=False
            Whether to use the heated or non-heated SB algorithm.
            See Notes for further information about the variants of the SB
            algorithm.
        verbose : bool, default=True
            Whether to display a progress bar to monitor the progress of
            the algorithm.
        early_stopping : bool, default=True, keyword-only
            Whether to use early stopping or not, making agents' convergence a
            stopping criterion. An agent is said to have converged if its energy
            has not changed over the last `convergence_threshold` energy samplings
            (done every `sampling_period` steps).
        sampling_period : int, default=50, keyword-only
            Number of iterations between two consecutive spins samplings used for
            early stopping.
        convergence_threshold : int, default=50, keyword-only
            Number of consecutive identical energy samplings considered as a
            proof of convergence of an agent.
        timeout : float | None, default=None
            Time in seconds after which the simulation is stopped.
            None means no timeout.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            The spins of all agents returned by the SB algorithm are stored
            in the `computed_spins` attribute.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        Hyperparameters corresponding to physical constants :
            These parameters have been fine-tuned (Goto et al.) to give the
            best results most of the time. Nevertheless, the relevance of
            specific hyperparameters may vary depending on the properties
            of the instances. They can respectively be modified and reset
            through the `set_env` and `reset_env` functions.

        Warns
        -----
        If `early_stopping` is True and no agent has reached the convergence
        criterion defined by `sampling_period` and `convergence_threshold`
        within `max_steps` iterations, a warning is logged in the console.
        This is just an indication however; the returned vectors may still
        be of good quality. Solutions to this warning include:

        - increasing the time step in the SB algorithm (may decrease
          numerical stability), see the `set_env` function.
        - increasing `max_steps` (at the expense of runtime).
        - changing the values of `ballistic` and `heated` to use
          different variants of the SB algorithm.
        - changing the values of some hyperparameters corresponding to
          physical constants (advanced usage, see Other Parameters).

        Warnings
        --------
        Approximation algorithm:
            The SB algorithm is an approximation algorithm, which implies
            that the returned values may not correspond to global optima.
            Therefore, if some constraints are embedded as penalties in the
            polynomial, that is adding terms that ensure that any global
            optimum satisfies the constraints, the return values may
            violate these constraints.
        Non-deterministic behaviour:
            The SB algorithm uses a randomized initialization, and this
            package is implemented with a PyTorch backend. To ensure a
            consistent initialization when running the same script multiple
            times, use `torch.manual_seed`. However, results may not be
            reproducible between CPU and GPU executions, even when using
            identical seeds. Furthermore, certain PyTorch operations are
            not deterministic. For more comprehensive details on
            reproducibility, refer to the PyTorch documentation available
            at https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html.

        Notes
        -----
        The original version of the SB algorithm [1] is not implemented
        since it is less efficient than the more recent variants of the SB
        algorithm described in [2]:

        - ballistic SB : Uses the position of the particles for the
          position-based update of the momentums ; usually faster but
          less accurate. Use this variant by setting
          `ballistic=True`.
        - discrete SB : Uses the sign of the position of the particles
          for the position-based update of the momentums ; usually
          slower but more accurate. Use this variant by setting
          `ballistic=False`.

        On top of these two variants, an additional thermal fluctuation
        term can be added in order to help escape local optima [3]. Use
        this additional term by setting `heated=True`.

        The space complexity O(M^2 + `agents` * M). The time complexity is
        O(`max_steps` * `agents` * M^2) where M is the dimension of the
        instance.

        For instances in low dimension (~100), running computations on GPU
        is slower than running computations on CPU unless a large number of
        agents (~2000) is used.
