"""
Implementation of the Simulated Bifurcation algorithm. This modules serves as
a back-end of the `core` module which helps define optimization problems to be
solved with the Simulated Bifurcation algorithm.

--------
core:
    Module of utility models to help define and solve optimization
    problems with the Simulated Bifurcation algorithm.
models:
    Package containing the implementation of several common combinatorial
    optimization problems.
